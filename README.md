## What

I keep an eye on your key performance indicators so you don't have to. I like working with:

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
    - code coverage
    - bundle size
    - build time
    - number of dependencies
    - lighthouse (performance, accessibility, best practices, seo, pwa)
